%Computer programming is an incredible tool for problem solving, but not everyone has the time, skills, or inclination to use it. Of course, the popular approach has always been to let the people with the skills develop audience-appropriate software.

This thesis will explore the approach of developing user-friendly GUI solver applications based on declarative problem specifications. The ultimate goal is to allow a programmer with zero web development knowledge to easily generate useful fully-functioning web applications using just the problem specifications, and without any need to touch the web application code.
