# Solves Development Challenges

## Key Knowledge Gaps

- How to actually write a good codebase generator?
    - I'll need to look into the approaches taken by other codebase generators such as:
        - [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) makes stub web apps as fully-functional node packages.
        - [openapi-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) makes REST API consumption libraries.
- Regex
    - Since this project involves syntax parsing, having a deeper understanding of the capabilities of regex systems will be advantageous.

## Key Challenges

- Generating web-developer-friendly code
    - It should be very easy to develop everything without web developers in mind.
    - Generating for web developers will mean we actually have to programmatically modify code.
